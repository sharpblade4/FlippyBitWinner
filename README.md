# FlippyBitWinner
A bot that plays "Flippy Bit" mobile game, better than human. It can currently auto press the needed hex given a decimal number. Next phase it using image processing to automatically locate the enemies and then OCR to make it understand the decimal by itself. 

Another direction that this winner hasn't gone through yet is reverse engineering the game a bit and apply memory manipulations.
